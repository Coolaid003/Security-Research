# Background
`BPF_FUNC_ringbuf_reserve` is used to allocate a memory chunk from `BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF`.  It reverses 8 bytes space to record header structure.
```C
/* 8-byte ring buffer record header structure */
struct bpf_ringbuf_hdr {
u32 len;
u32 pg_off;
};
```
And return `(void *)hdr + BPF_RINGBUF_HDR_SZ` for ebpf program to use.  ebpf program is unable to modify `bpf_ringbuf_hdr` due to it is outside of memory chunk.  

But with malformed `&rb->consumer_pos`, it's possible to make second allocated memory chunk overlapping with first chunk.  
As the result, ebpf program is able to edit first chunk's hdr.  

For example, we create a `BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF` with size is 0x4000. Modify `consumer_pos` to 0x3000 before call `BPF_FUNC_ringbuf_reserve`.  

Allocate chunk A, it will be in [0x0,0x3008], and ebpf program is able to edit [0x8,0x3008].  Now allocate chunk B with size 0x3000, it will sucess because we edit consumer_pos ahead to pass the check. Chunk B will be in [0x3008,0x6010], and ebpf program is able to edit [0x3010,0x6010].  

```C
/* check for out of ringbuf space by ensuring producer position
* doesn't advance more than (ringbuf_size - 1) ahead
*/
if (new_prod_pos - cons_pos > rb->mask) {
spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rb->spinlock, flags);
return NULL;
}
```

Due to ringbuf memory layout in the following description.  
```C
/* Each data page is mapped twice to allow "virtual"
* continuous read of samples wrapping around the end of ring
* buffer area:
* ------------------------------------------------------
* | meta pages |  real data pages  |  same data pages  |
* ------------------------------------------------------
* |            | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 |
* ------------------------------------------------------
* |            | TA             DA | TA             DA |
* ------------------------------------------------------
*                               ^^^^^^^
*                                  |
```

`[0x0,0x4000]` and `[0x4000,0x8000]` points to same data pages.  
It means that chunk B at `[0x4000,0x4008]` is chunk A's hdr.  

`BPF_FUNC_ringbuf_submit`/`BPF_FUNC_ringbuf_discard` use hdr's pg_off to locate the meta pages.  

```C
bpf_ringbuf_restore_from_rec(struct bpf_ringbuf_hdr *hdr)
{
unsigned long addr = (unsigned long)(void *)hdr;
unsigned long off = (unsigned long)hdr->pg_off << PAGE_SHIFT;

return (void*)((addr & PAGE_MASK) - off);
}
static void bpf_ringbuf_commit(void *sample, u64 flags, bool discard)
{
unsigned long rec_pos, cons_pos;
struct bpf_ringbuf_hdr *hdr;
struct bpf_ringbuf *rb;
u32 new_len;

hdr = sample - BPF_RINGBUF_HDR_SZ;
rb = bpf_ringbuf_restore_from_rec(hdr);
```

# Exploit
We modify `pg_off` of chunk A to `2`, so the meta pages that calculated with `bpf_ringbuf_restore_from_rec` will point to our controlled content at mmap-ed consumer pos data.
```
static void bpf_ringbuf_commit(void *sample, u64 flags, bool discard)
{
	...
	rb = bpf_ringbuf_restore_from_rec(hdr);
	...

	if (flags & BPF_RB_FORCE_WAKEUP)
		irq_work_queue(&rb->work);\
  ...
```
By crafting `work` field inside `bpf_ringbuf` and call `bpf_ringbuf_commit` with `BPF_RB_FORCE_WAKEUP` it will call our crafted `irq_work` object to `irq_work_queue`.
Crafted irq_work will processed at `irq_work_single` and will execute our controlled function pointer.
```
void irq_work_single(void *arg)
{
    struct irq_work *work = arg;
    int flags;

    flags = atomic_read(&work->node.a_flags);
    flags &= ~IRQ_WORK_PENDING;
    atomic_set(&work->node.a_flags, flags);

    ...
    lockdep_irq_work_enter(flags);
    work->func(work); // [1]
    lockdep_irq_work_exit(flags);
    ...
}
```

# KASLR Bypass
To bypass kASLR we refer to this [technique](https://github.com/google/security-research/blob/master/pocs/linux/kernelctf/CVE-2023-6817_mitigation/docs/exploit.md#kaslr-bypass).

# ROP Chain
By observation we see RBX/RDI will contain the address of `work` field and we can control the ROP data started at `RDI + 0x18`. Then, we use this ROP chain for stack pivot to our controlled data.
```
0x00000000004b78b1 : push rbx ; or byte ptr [rbx + 0x41], bl ; pop rsp ; pop r13 ; pop rbp ; ret
```
Then we continue to execute ROP payload that will overwrite `core_pattern` to our exploit. By trigger crash it will execute our exploit as high privileged.
