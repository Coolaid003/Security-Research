# CVE-2021-22555: Turning \x00\x00 into 10000$

This Proof-Of-Concept demonstrates the exploitation of [CVE-2023-2163](https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-j87x-j6mh-mv8v).

## Technical details

A bug in the eBPF Verifier branch pruning logic can lead to unsafe code paths
being incorrectly marked as safe. As demonstrated in the exploitation section,
this can be leveraged to get arbitrary read/write in kernel memory, 
leading to LPE and Container escape.

## Usage

```sh
$ make
$ ./exploit
```
